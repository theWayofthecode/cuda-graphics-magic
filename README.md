cuda-graphics-magic
===================

Optimized with cuda a couple of operations of the graphics magic suite.

Me and my colegue Martha Peppa as part of a undergraduate HPC project (Sprint 2011)
optimized the convolution and the median filters by utilizing the CUDA technology. 
We achieved ~8x speedup with Fermi class nvidia GPU.
